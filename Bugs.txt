Map:
* Treasure chests will swap back to closed when the dialogue box is drawn. (Needs to be confirmed, footage is from old version.)


Battle:
* Fixed: Enemy level was being saved to ROM pointers, not RAM.

* Enemies have an unused ailment chance byte... 

* SelectPlayerTarget has some obfuscating code that I will need to hijack for Multi-targeting.

* Regen/Poison - make sure its loading the right division bytes and ORA-ing the other right one.

* Praying doesn't crouch the character

* Spells need to be tested to cast properly.
* Cover needs to be tested.
* Parry needs to be tested.
* Enemies strike first will still have all your characters (with poison) poison-damaged before their turn. Is this a bug?
* Set "Mag.Def" to "M.Evade" in level up text. (does it even show?)


Menu:
* Exiting the soundtest menu will scramble NPC sprites for a frame?
* Adjust loading of backgrounds so that music is not stalled for several frames between screens.

MiniMap:
* Check: Adding a new teleport location may not add a glowy pixel to the map.



Ideas:
* Put Healed amount into a string then print it in HP Up messaging. 

* Variable Magic: Spells that can either target 1 enemy, all enemies (reduced potency), 1 player, or all players (reduced potency). Will this require drawing shimmering glovehands when highlighting multiple targets?

* Shop: Characters pose when able to learn a spell. -- This is a little too difficult at the moment, and would require extensive changes and keeping track of which bytes of tmp are used...
