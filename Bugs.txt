Map:
* Treasure chests will swap back to closed when the dialogue box is drawn. (Needs to be confirmed, footage is from old version.)

Shop:
* Thank you, Anything else? dialogue is overwritten by immediately jumping back to the Buy/Sell option. Since buying things is just so easy now, I suggest returning to the Buy/Sell/Exit option after every purchase or sale? 


Battle:
* Using an item sometimes flashes a garbage sprite somewhere near characters 3 and 4.

* Praying doesn't crouch the character
* Focus doesn't display the poof sprite

* Spells need to be tested to cast properly.
* Cover needs to be tested.
* Parry needs to be tested.
* Enemies strike first will still have all your characters (with poison) poison-damaged before their turn. Is this a bug?
* Set "Mag.Def" to "M.Evade" in level up text. (does it even show?)

Stats:
Unequipping and re-equipping gear does not cap stats, and maybe should?

Menu:
* Exiting the soundtest menu will scramble NPC sprites for a frame?
* Adjust loading of backgrounds so that music is not stalled for several frames between screens.

MiniMap:
* Check: Adding a new teleport location may not add a glowy pixel to the map.



Ideas:
* Put Healed amount into a string then print it in HP Up messaging. 

* Battle: Random chance for enemies who have more than 1 physical attack against another target per round, to do or not do the second, third, fourth, etc, attack.

* Variable Magic: Spells that can either target 1 enemy, all enemies (reduced potency), 1 player, or all players (reduced potency). Will this require drawing shimmering glovehands when highlighting multiple targets?

* Shop: Characters pose when able to learn a spell.

* Failed Prayer raises spirit by 10.
