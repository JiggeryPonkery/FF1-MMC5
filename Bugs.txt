Map:
* Treasure chests will swap back to closed when the dialogue box is drawn. (Needs to be confirmed, footage is from old version.)
- Cannot walk under a bridge an NPC is standing on top of. : Fixed by disallowing NPCs to walk on bridges.
* Should not be able to talk to people while under a bridge! (or in water?)


Battle:
* Using a Soft tried to cast "Bolt" then crashed the game. Test all items.
- Weapon sprite loading takes too long and causes stoned characters to flicker blue for a frame. : Fixed -- was actually the loading of the palette, since the player's chosen background colour was put into the default palette, which was reset after WaitForVBlank's exit turned it grey.
* Weapon animations lag 1 frame behind character movements.
* Cheering after battle needs to be adjusted to be a few frames quicker.
* Spells need to be tested to cast properly.
* Pray needs to be tested.
* Cover needs to be tested.
* Parry needs to be tested.
* Stealing seems to mis-draw boxes.
* Focus seems to mis-draw boxes.


Shops:
* Adjust text strings for items and spells to make sure they will overwrite previous item's decriptions.


Ideas:
* Battle: Random chance for enemies who have more than 1 physical attack against another target per round, to do or not do the second, third, fourth, etc, attack.

* Battle Graphics: Randomize the LUT that draws the background. Compare randomized number against previous 2 numbers: If last random numbers were 1, then 1, then third number must be 3. After each random number: 2 must follow 1, 4 must follow 3. Move background drawing to Bank B to make more fixed bank space.

* Variable Magic: Spells that can either target 1 enemy, all enemies (reduced potency), 1 player, or all players (reduced potency). Will this require drawing shimmering glovehands when highlighting multiple targets?

* Shop: Characterse pose when able to learn a spell.
